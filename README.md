# We need a project name!

#### Setting up an environment with conda

```conda create -c conda-forge -n env-name rdkit jupyter```

This version is stable right now - we need to keep on eye on this if we encounter bugs

```pip install selfies==1.0.3```

The ```mutate_selfie.py``` file is the isolated function to work with and reference.  

The ```team_notes.ipynb``` file is to share functions that we use in development and later on we can create a module for them in the source code.
